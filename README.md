# Password Strength Checker

This Python tool assesses the strength of a password based on several criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on how secure their password is.

## Features
- **Length Check**: Ensures the password has at least 8 characters.
- **Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: Verifies the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Numbers**: Checks if the password contains numbers.
- **Special Characters**: Ensures the inclusion of special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).
- **Password Strength Feedback**: Based on the above criteria, provides feedback like **Very Weak**, **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.
